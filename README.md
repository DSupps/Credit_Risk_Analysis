# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Challenge Overview:
*Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.*

*Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.*

*Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.*

*Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.*

*Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk*
